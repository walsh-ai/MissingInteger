Given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A. 

E.g. given input A = {1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2}, the solution should return 5. 

A = [1, 2, 3], return 4 
A = [-1, -3], return 1

For this, an efficient algorithm is required under the following assumptions:(1) N is an integer in range [1, 100000]; (2) each element of A is an integer in the ragne [-1000000, 1000000]
